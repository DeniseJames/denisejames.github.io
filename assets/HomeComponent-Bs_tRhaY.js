She chaired weekly meetings with sub-system engineers to keep software development on schedule and to ensure accurate data for software release. Furthermore, she regularly found areas for process improvement and suggested effective countermeasures for improving data accuracy and work efficiency.

She kept the team on task with electronic vehicle software schedules on a shared secure location. I will never forget the time another team member was unavailable for an issue with the software in a vehicle launch.
